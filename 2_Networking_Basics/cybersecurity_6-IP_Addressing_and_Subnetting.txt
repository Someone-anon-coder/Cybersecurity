IP Addressing and Subnetting

IP addressing and subnetting are foundational concepts in networking. 
They help devices communicate with each other over a network or the internet. 
Understanding how IP addresses work, how to break them into subnets, and how subnetting improves network efficiency and security is critical for anyone working in networking or cybersecurity.

Let's break down the concepts:

1. IP Addressing:

    An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to devices (like computers, routers, or servers) that enables them to communicate on a network.
    
    IP addresses are classified into two versions:
        - IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
        - IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
    
    IPv4 Addressing:

        IPv4 is the most widely used version and consists of 32 bits, which are typically represented as 4 octets (8-bit blocks), written in dotted decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
        Each octet in an IPv4 address can represent a value between 0 and 255 (8 bits = 256 possible values).
        
        Example: 192.168.1.1 is an IPv4 address where: 
            - 192 is the first octet
            - 168 is the second octet
            - 1 is the third octet
            - 1 is the fourth octet
    
    IPv6 Addressing:

        IPv6 was introduced to address the limitations of IPv4 (such as the finite number of available addresses). 
        It uses 128 bits, written as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by colons (:).
        Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is an IPv6 address.
        IPv6 addresses provide an almost unlimited number of addresses, solving the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.
        
        Components of an IPv4 Address:
            - Network portion: Identifies the network the device belongs to.
            - Host portion: Identifies the specific device (host) within that network.
        
        The network and host portions are determined by a subnet mask (more on this in subnetting). 
        The subnet mask specifies which part of the address is used for the network and which part is used for the host.


2. Subnetting:

    Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). 
    Subnetting allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, improves network performance, and enhances security by isolating network segments.

    Why Subnetting is Needed:

        - IP Address Conservation: By creating smaller subnets, networks can avoid wasting IP addresses.
        - Network Segmentation: Subnetting can help limit broadcast traffic, improve security, and reduce congestion.
        - Organizing Networks: Subnets allow networks to be logically divided based on departments, regions, or services.
    
    Subnet Mask:

        A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that defines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion. 
        It essentially "masks" the IP address to identify the network and host bits.

        Standard subnet masks:

            - 255.0.0.0 or /8 for Class A networks (8 bits for network, 24 bits for host).
            - 255.255.0.0 or /16 for Class B networks (16 bits for network, 16 bits for host).
            - 255.255.255.0 or /24 for Class C networks (24 bits for network, 8 bits for host).
        
        CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):

            CIDR notation is an alternative way to express subnet masks. 
            Instead of using the full subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0), CIDR notation uses a slash (/) followed by the number of bits in the network portion.

            Example: 192.168.1.0/24: This means that the first 24 bits are used for the network address, and the remaining 8 bits are for host addresses.
        
        Subnetting Process:

            1) Identify the Network and Host Portion: Given an IP address and subnet mask, determine how many bits are used for the network and host portions.
            2) Calculate Subnets: You can borrow bits from the host portion to create subnets. For example, if you borrow 2 bits from the host portion in a /24 network, you create a /26 subnet, which allows for more subnets but fewer hosts per subnet.
            3) Subnet Address and Range:
                - Network Address: The first address in the subnet, used to identify the network.
                - Broadcast Address: The last address in the subnet, used to broadcast messages to all devices within that subnet.
                - Valid Host Addresses: The range of IP addresses between the network and broadcast address. These can be assigned to devices.


3. Classful Addressing vs. Classless Addressing

    Historically, IP addresses were divided into classes, each with a predefined range of addresses. These classes were:

    Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255

        - Subnet mask: /8 (e.g., 255.0.0.0)
        - Supports large networks (16 million hosts).
    
    Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

        - Subnet mask: /16 (e.g., 255.255.0.0)
        - Supports medium-sized networks (65,000 hosts).
    
    Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

        - Subnet mask: /24 (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
        - Supports smaller networks (254 hosts).
    
    However, classful addressing was inefficient, as it didnâ€™t allow for flexible subnetting. 
    This led to the adoption of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), which allows networks to be divided based on the number of bits needed, without adhering to the rigid class boundaries.


4. Example of Subnetting

    Problem: You have the IP address 192.168.1.0/24 and need to divide it into 4 subnets.

    Step 1: Determine the number of bits to borrow

        - Start with /24 (which means 24 bits for the network).
        - To create 4 subnets, you need to borrow 2 bits from the host portion (because 2^2 = 4).
    
        Thus, the new subnet mask becomes /26 (24 bits + 2 borrowed bits = 26 bits for the network portion).
    
    Step 2: Calculate the subnets

        - The new subnet mask is 255.255.255.192 (/26).
        - The network address is 192.168.1.0, and the range of subnets will be:

            Subnet # | Subnet Address   | First Host Address | Last Host Address | Broadcast Address | Number of Hosts
            1        | 192.168.1.0/26   | 192.168.1.1        | 192.168.1.62      | 192.168.1.63      | 62
            2        | 192.168.1.64/26  | 192.168.1.65       | 192.168.1.126     | 192.168.1.127     | 62
            3        | 192.168.1.128/26 | 192.168.1.129      | 192.168.1.190     | 192.168.1.191     | 62
            4        | 192.168.1.192/26 | 192.168.1.193      | 192.168.1.254     | 192.168.1.255     | 62
    
    Step 3: Verify the result

        - Each subnet has 62 usable IP addresses, and each subnet can support up to 62 devices. 
        - The first and last addresses in each subnet are reserved for the network and broadcast addresses, respectively.


5. Practical Applications of Subnetting

    - IP Address Conservation: Efficiently allocate IP addresses in large organizations to avoid wasting addresses.
    - Network Segmentation: Isolate different network segments (e.g., separating departments like HR, Finance, etc.) for security, performance, and management purposes.
    - Security: By segmenting networks, you can limit access between subnets, thus controlling how data flows within the network and preventing lateral movement in case of a security breach.
    - Routing Efficiency: Subnetting allows routers to manage traffic more effectively by reducing the number of devices per subnet and limiting broadcast traffic.
