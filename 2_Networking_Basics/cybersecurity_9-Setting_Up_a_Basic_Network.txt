Setting Up a Basic Network in VirtualBox with Ubuntu ISO

In this practical exercise, we’ll set up a basic network using VirtualBox and Ubuntu as the guest operating system. 
We’ll configure two virtual machines (VMs) to represent two different networks, and configure networking between them. 
This will help you understand how routers, switches, and IP addressing work in a virtualized environment.

Prerequisites:

    - Virtualbox: Download virtual box for your machine
    - Ubuntu ISO: In this example we will use ubuntu ISO to simulate a network. Search ubuntu iso and download the latest version


1) Create Two Virtual Machines in VirtualBox:

    - Open VirtualBox and click on New to create the first virtual machine.
    - Name: Ubuntu-VM1
    - Type: Linux
    - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the VM:
        - Memory Size: 1024 MB (or more, depending on your system)
        - Hard Disk: Create a new virtual disk (e.g., 10GB)
        - Choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) and Dynamically allocated.

    - After creating the VM, proceed with installing Ubuntu using the ISO file.
    - Repeat the process to create a second VM (e.g., Ubuntu-VM2).


2) Configure VirtualBox Network Settings

    For this exercise, we’ll use two virtual network adapters for each VM to simulate two networks. 
    VirtualBox allows you to create multiple virtual networks using different network modes like NAT, Bridged, Host-Only, and Internal. 
    Here, we’ll use Internal Network for communication between the VMs and NAT for internet access.
    
    VM1 (Ubuntu-VM1) Setup:

        - Open Settings for Ubuntu-VM1 in VirtualBox.
        - Navigate to Network.
        - Enable Adapter 1 and set the Attached to option to Internal Network.
            - Name: intnet (This is a custom network name that both VMs will use for communication)
        
        - Enable Adapter 2 and set the Attached to option to NAT for internet access.

    VM2 (Ubuntu-VM2) Setup:

        - Open Settings for Ubuntu-VM2.
        - Navigate to Network.
        - Enable Adapter 1 and set the Attached to option to Internal Network.
            - Name: intnet
        
        - Enable Adapter 2 and set the Attached to option to NAT.

3) Install Ubuntu on Both VMs

    - Start Ubuntu-VM1 and mount the Ubuntu ISO in the virtual CD/DVD drive.
    - Go through the installation steps:
        - Set language, timezone, keyboard layout, and username/password.
        - Install Ubuntu alongside other settings as needed.
    
    - After installation, repeat the process for Ubuntu-VM2.


4. Network Configuration on Ubuntu VMs

    Once both VMs are running Ubuntu, we’ll configure network settings inside each VM.
    Configure Static IP Addresses for the Internal Network:

    - On Ubuntu-VM1:

        - Open the terminal in Ubuntu-VM1.
        - Use ip a to list network interfaces and identify the network interface for Adapter 1 (which is connected to the internal network).
            - Usually, the interface will be named something like enp0s3 or ens33.
        
        - Edit the network configuration file to assign a static IP: sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
        - Modify the file to configure a static IP (example IP address: 192.168.1.2):

            network:
              version: 2
              renderer: networkd
              ethernets:
                enp0s3:
                  dhcp4: no
                  addresses:
                    - 192.168.1.2/24
                  gateway4: 192.168.1.1

        - This sets the IP address to 192.168.1.2 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.
        - The gateway is not strictly needed for internal network communication but will be used for internet access (via the NAT adapter).
        - Apply the changes: sudo netplan apply

    - On Ubuntu-VM2:

        - Open the terminal in Ubuntu-VM2.
        - Use ip a to find the interface name (e.g., enp0s3).
        - Edit the network configuration file to assign a static IP (example IP address: 192.168.1.3): sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
        - Modify the file similarly:

            network:
              version: 2
              renderer: networkd
              ethernets:
                enp0s3:
                  dhcp4: no
                  addresses:
                    - 192.168.1.3/24
                  gateway4: 192.168.1.1
        - Apply the changes: sudo netplan apply


5. Verify Connectivity Between VMs

    Now that both VMs have static IP addresses configured on the same internal network (192.168.1.0/24), you can verify if the two VMs can communicate with each other.
    
    From Ubuntu-VM1:

        - Open a terminal.
        - Ping Ubuntu-VM2’s IP address (192.168.1.3): ping 192.168.1.3

    You should see replies from 192.168.1.3, indicating that the two VMs are connected.

    From Ubuntu-VM2:

        - Open a terminal.
        - Ping Ubuntu-VM1’s IP address (192.168.1.2): ping 192.168.1.2

    You should see replies from 192.168.1.2, confirming that the two VMs can communicate.
