Nmap Service Version Detection

Service version detection is one of the most powerful features of Nmap, allowing you to identify the versions of services running on open ports. 
By knowing the version of the service, you can assess vulnerabilities, outdated software, or misconfigurations that could pose a security risk.
When a service is running on a port (like HTTP on port 80, FTP on port 21, or SSH on port 22), Nmap can send specific probes to determine the exact version of the service. 
This is especially helpful for penetration testing, as certain versions of software may have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.


How Does Nmap Service Version Detection Work?

    When you scan a target for service version detection, Nmap sends a series of probes to the open ports to identify the specific version of the service running. 
    The service may respond with information that includes the version number, protocol details, and other relevant metadata.
    
    Nmap uses a collection of service probes and matching patterns to identify the versions of common services such as:

        - Web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
        - Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
        - File transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP)
        - Remote access protocols (SSH, RDP)
        - And many more...

    Nmap also has a Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) that further enhances service version detection by running scripts to gather more specific details, such as supported protocols, known vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.


Basic Command for Service Version Detection

    To perform service version detection with Nmap, use the -sV option. Here's the syntax: nmap -sV [target]
        - -sV: This option enables version detection.
        - [target]: This is the IP address or hostname of the system you want to scan.
    
    Example: Scan a single host for open ports and service versions: nmap -sV 192.168.1.5
    This will show the services running on the target system and the versions of those services.

Explanation of Output:

    - Port: The port number and protocol (22/tcp, 80/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, 1434/tcp, 9929/tcp, 31337/tcp).
    - State: The port's state (open, filtered).
    - Service: The service running on the open port (ssh, http, netbios-ssn, microsoft-ds, ms-sql-m, nping-echo, tcpwrapped).
    - Version: The version of the service running on the port (OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.13, Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))).

    In this example, Nmap found several services running on the target host, including SSH, HTTP, ms-sql-m, tcpwrapped and detected their versions.


Using Nmap with Version Detection on Specific Ports

    You can limit the service version detection to specific ports if you know the targetâ€™s service configuration. 
    Use the -p option to specify which ports to scan for version detection.

    Example: Scan only HTTP (port 80) and MySQL (port 3306) on a target: nmap -sV -p 80,3306 192.168.1.5
    This will check the version of the HTTP and MySQL services on the specified ports.


Service Version Detection with Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

    The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an advanced feature that allows you to run scripts against the target to gather more detailed information about services, including their versions. 
    NSE scripts can detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and perform additional probing.
    You can use the -sC flag to run a set of default NSE scripts, which includes version detection scripts. 
    To enable NSE scripting along with version detection, use both -sV and -sC.

    Example: Run service version detection and NSE scripts for more detailed information: nmap -sV -sC 192.168.1.5
    
    This command combines version detection and default NSE scripts. 
    It may return additional information like SSL certificate details, known vulnerabilities, and other relevant data about the services.
