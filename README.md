# Cybersecurity Learning Progress Tracker

This repository is a personal guide to learning cybersecurity from basics to advanced concepts. I'll be documenting my learning progress here and anyone else interested can follow along or contribute.

## Learning Objectives
This repository covers both theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on skills in cybersecurity. I will be using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and writing code in C, C++, and Bash for various concepts.
